       <h3> Our Story</h3>
         <p> After winning the Washington State Lottery in 2015, Bernie Black Bear was finally able to realize his dream of providing accommodations and amenities for rest and relaxation to animals from all over the world.
         </p>
         <p>
         Bernie teamed up with his long-time travel companion Harvey Hippo, who provides the business savvy to make this venture both practical and sustainable.
